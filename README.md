# sketchplugin-generate-random-person
Pull randomly generated person from DuckDuckGo API.

## Caveats
This is just a simple proof-of-concept. Handle with care ;)

## Usage
Copy-paste the contents of `skript.js` into Sketch -> "Plugins" -> "Run Skripts..." and press run. It should generate a new text element with the information of a (non-existent, randomly generated) person. Might help if you're not in the mood of coming-up-with-random-people!
